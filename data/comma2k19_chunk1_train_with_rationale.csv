- Where is the vehicle driving? What is a typical speed in this environment?  
  The vehicle is on a multi-lane freeway at night. Typical freeway speeds in this setting range from 55 to 75 mph, depending on posted limits and traffic flow.  
- What are the driving conditions? How should this impact the speed?  
  The pavement appears dry, visibility is reduced due to darkness but there is no rain or snow. Under clear but low-light conditions, the driver should maintain freeway speed while remaining vigilant, possibly at the upper end of the speed limit if comfortable and conditions remain stable.  
- What other agents are in the scene? What are their potential actions? How should that impact the driver’s speed?  
  There are very few vehicles visible: one car in an adjacent lane ahead to the right, and tail lights in the distance. No pedestrians or cyclists. Other vehicles could brake or change lanes unexpectedly, so the driver should keep a safe following distance and be ready to reduce speed, but can otherwise maintain a steady freeway pace.

2. Steering Angle  
- What is the curvature of the lane?  
  The lane is essentially straight with only a very gentle alignment; no significant left or right bend is visible.  
- Are there any potential obstacles in the driver’s way? If so, how should the driver steer to avoid them?  
  There are no obstacles on the roadway surface. Guardrails and signage are off the travel lanes. No steering adjustments are needed beyond maintaining lane centering.  
- What other agents are in the scene? What are their potential actions? How should that impact the driver’s steering angle?  
  The lone vehicle to the right could drift or change lanes; the driver should maintain lane discipline and be prepared to make a slight corrective steering input if another car encroaches, but otherwise hold a straight steering angle.

- The vehicle is on a multi-lane suburban arterial (city street with a center median and parallel parked cars). Typical speeds on such roads range from 30–45 mph.  
- Conditions are overcast but dry, with good visibility and no precipitation. These clear, dry conditions support traveling at the posted limit but still warrant vigilance for changing circumstances.  
- Other agents include several moving vehicles ahead in the same direction, a car parked at the curb on the right, and oncoming traffic. The lead vehicles may slow or change lanes; parked cars could pull out. To maintain a safe following distance and allow reaction time, the driver should moderate speed, avoiding sudden braking or acceleration.

2. Steering Angle  
- The lane ahead is straight with only a very slight alignment drift; there is no significant left or right curvature.  
- There are no immediate obstacles in the driving lane. Parked cars at the curb are off the roadway but should be monitored in case they pull away.  
- Moving vehicles in adjacent lanes could drift or merge. Pedestrians are not visible on sidewalks, and no cyclists are in the lane. The driver should maintain a centered position in the lane, steering straight but ready to counter any drift or evasive maneuvers if a vehicle suddenly enters the lane.

- The vehicle is traveling on a multi-lane freeway. Typical speeds on such highways range from 55 to 75 mph, depending on local limits and traffic flow.  
- The weather is overcast but dry, with no rain or snow visible. Dry pavement and good visibility allow for normal freeway speeds, though overcast light may require slightly increased vigilance.  
- Other vehicles are present in adjacent and forward lanes. The convertible in the left lane and the sedan directly ahead could slow, merge, or change lanes. To maintain safe following distance, the driver should monitor their speeds and be prepared to decelerate if one of them brakes or drifts.

2. Steering Angle  
- The road is predominantly straight with a very gentle leftward curvature, as indicated by the guardrail on the right curving away and the lane markings angling slightly left.  
- There are no immediate fixed obstacles in the lane. The driver should stay centered in their lane, making minor leftward steering to follow the roadway’s subtle left bend.  
- The convertible to the left and other vehicles ahead could shift lanes unexpectedly. The driver should maintain a steady steering input, make gradual adjustments to stay within the lane, and avoid abrupt movements.

- The vehicle is driving on a city street at an intersection with trolley tracks and crosswalks. Typical urban speeds here range from 25 to 35 mph.  
- It appears to be overcast but dry, so traction is normal. No need to reduce speed for weather, but remain alert to changes (puddles, slick spots).  
- There are parked cars on both sides and a crosswalk directly ahead. Pedestrians could step into the roadway, and other road users (trolley, bikes) may emerge from between parked cars. This environment calls for a moderate speed—slow enough to stop for a pedestrian crossing or a streetcar pulling out, but not so slow as to block traffic flow.

2. Steering Angle  
- The lane ahead incorporates trolley tracks that curve gently to the right, and the painted lane guide lines also bend right.  
- A parked SUV on the right curb encroaches slightly into the driver’s peripheral path; the driver should stay centered in the lane, following the gentle right curvature, to maintain safe clearance.  
- No moving vehicles or pedestrians are currently in the driver’s immediate path, but the potential for someone stepping out from between parked cars on either side requires a steady, predictable steering approach—track the lane curve smoothly rather than making sudden corrections.

- Environment: The vehicle is on a multi-lane divided freeway at night. Typical speeds on such freeways range from 55–75 mph, depending on posted limits.  
- Conditions: The roadway appears clear and dry, with good visibility aided by the vehicle’s headlights. Night driving warrants slightly increased following distances and attentiveness, but does not by itself require drastic speed reduction in clear conditions.  
- Other agents: There are several cars visible in the right lanes ahead, traveling at or near freeway speeds. Their potential actions include maintaining lane position or shifting lanes to pass slower traffic. To maintain a safe following distance and keep pace with traffic, the driver should hold a speed near the upper end of the freeway range while being ready to decelerate if any vehicle ahead slows or merges unpredictably.

2. Steering Angle  
- Lane curvature: The lane marking and yellow centerline appear almost perfectly straight with only a very gentle rightward sweep.  
- Obstacles: No debris, parked vehicles, or pedestrians are present in the lane of travel.  
- Other agents: All other vehicles are in adjacent lanes; none are encroaching into the host lane. The driver can keep the steering wheel centered, with only minimal micro-adjustments to stay aligned within the lane.

- The vehicle is on a multi-lane city street approaching a signalized intersection. Typical posted speeds in this environment range from 25–35 mph.  
- Weather and road conditions appear clear and dry, which under normal circumstances would allow travel at the posted speed limit. However, approaching a red traffic signal requires a significant reduction in speed.  
- Other agents: multiple vehicles are stopped in all lanes at the red light. There may be pedestrians beginning to step off the curb when the light changes. To avoid a rear-end collision and to yield to crossings, the driver should slow to a near stop well before the stop line.

2. Steering Angle  
- The lane markings ahead are straight with no visible curvature.  
- There are no unexpected obstacles in the lane, only stopped cars directly ahead.  
- Other agents (cars stopped ahead, potential pedestrians at the crosswalk) require the driver to maintain a straight heading aligned with the lane so as not to encroach into adjacent lanes or the crosswalk area.

- Environment: The vehicle is on a multi-lane freeway. Typical speeds on this type of road range from 55–70 mph depending on the posted limit and traffic flow.  
- Conditions: The sky is overcast but the pavement is dry and visibility is good. In clear, dry conditions on a freeway, the driver can safely maintain near the speed limit, adjusting only for traffic.  
- Other agents: There are passenger cars in adjacent lanes and a medium-sized truck in the right lane. None are suddenly decelerating or merging aggressively. To maintain safe spacing and traffic flow, the driver should match the prevailing freeway speed (around 65 mph).  

2. Steering Angle  
- Lane curvature: The lanes ahead are essentially straight with no significant left or right bends.  
- Obstacles: No debris or static obstacles are visible in the vehicle’s lane.  
- Other agents: Surrounding vehicles are maintaining their lanes without drifting. As long as the driver holds a centered position within the lane, no steering corrections beyond keeping the wheel straight are needed.

- Where is the vehicle driving (freeway, city streets, etc.)? What is a typical speed in this environment?  
  The vehicle is on a multi-lane freeway. Typical speeds on this type of suburban freeway range from 55–65 mph, though actual traffic may flow more slowly.  
- What are the driving conditions (clear, snowing, raining, etc.)? How should this impact the speed the vehicle is moving?  
  Conditions are clear with dry pavement and good visibility. Under these ideal conditions, maintaining typical freeway speed is appropriate, provided traffic flow and spacing allow.  
- What other agents are in the scene (other vehicles, bikers, pedestrians, etc.)? What are their potential actions (slowing down, walking in front of the car, swerving into the lane, etc)? How should that impact the driver's speed?  
  Two neighboring vehicles are visible: one in the left lane and one in the right lane. Both appear to be traveling steadily. No pedestrians or cyclists are present. The driver should match the flow of traffic, maintain safe following distance, and be prepared to decelerate slightly if either vehicle changes lanes or slows.

2. Steering Angle  
- What is the curvature of the lane the vehicle is driving in? Is the lane straight, curved left, curved right, or other?  
  The lane ahead is essentially straight with no significant curvature.  
- Are there any potential obstacles in the driver’s way? If so, how should the driver steer to avoid these obstacles?  
  No obstacles (debris, stalled vehicles, etc.) are present in the immediate path. The driver should maintain lane centering.  
- What other agents are in the scene (other vehicles, bikers, pedestrians, etc.)? What are their potential actions (slowing down, walking in front of the car, swerving into the lane, etc)? How should that impact the driver's steering angle?  
  The adjacent vehicles are stable in their lanes. The driver should keep the steering wheel centered (straight) while monitoring mirror checks in case another vehicle drifts or overtakes.

- The vehicle is on a multi-lane urban street, likely approaching or stopped at an intersection. Typical posted speeds here would be in the 25–35 mph range, though lower speeds are common when there is signalized traffic.  
- Conditions are clear and dry, so there is no weather-related reduction in visibility or traction required. Under normal flow you could travel at the posted limit, but current traffic flow is stopped or moving very slowly.  
- Other agents: a black SUV immediately ahead is at a standstill or creeping, with additional vehicles queued in the adjacent lane. There are no pedestrians in the crosswalk at this moment, but the stopped queue and intersection control demand a near-zero speed until the light changes.  

2. Steering Angle  
- The lane ahead is straight with no curvature.  
- There are no obstacles intruding into the lane; lane markings are clear and continuous.  
- Other vehicles flank the driver’s car on the left and ahead; maintaining a centered, straight steering angle avoids encroaching on neighboring lanes or causing side collisions.

- The vehicle is driving on a multi-lane freeway. Typical speeds on this type of road are in the range of 55–75 mph, with many limits around 65 mph.  
- It is nighttime but the pavement appears dry and visibility, while reduced, is adequate. Under clear, dry conditions the vehicle can safely maintain freeway speeds, though slightly slower speeds can be chosen if the driver is wary of glare or reduced sight distance.  
- Other agents consist of distant moving vehicles in adjacent lanes and parked cars on the right shoulder. None are merging immediately into the lane, and no pedestrians or cyclists are present. These conditions allow maintaining a steady freeway speed, with readiness to slow if a vehicle ahead significantly decelerates.

2. Steering Angle  
- The lane ahead is straight with no noticeable curvature.  
- There are no obstacles in the driving lane; parked cars are off to the shoulder and do not intrude into the travel lanes.  
- Other agents (far-ahead vehicles) remain centered in their lanes and show no signs of abrupt lateral movements. The driver should keep the wheels aligned to the lane center, maintaining a straight trajectory.

- The vehicle is driving on a multi-lane divided freeway. Typical posted speeds in this environment range from 65–75 mph, with actual traffic often flowing around 60–70 mph.  
- The conditions are clear and dry under bright daylight. With good visibility and dry pavement, the driver can comfortably maintain near the posted limit, but must remain vigilant for traffic flow changes.  
- Other agents: there are several passenger cars ahead in the center and right lanes, spaced at safe but not excessive gaps. They may slow or change lanes unpredictably. The driver should match the freeway flow (avoiding tail-gating) and be prepared to softly decelerate if the lead cars brake or merge.

2. Steering Angle  
- The lane ahead is essentially straight, with only a very gentle grade and no significant curvature.  
- No static obstacles (debris, stalled vehicles, barrier encroachments) appear in the driver’s path.

- The vehicle is driving on city streets in a residential/urban neighborhood. Typical speeds here range from 25–35 mph (often posted as 25 mph).  
- The driving conditions appear to be dry pavement under overcast skies, with good visibility and no precipitation. This allows maintaining normal city speeds but does not warrant higher speeds due to potential hidden hazards.  
- Parked cars line both sides of the street. Pedestrians or cyclists could emerge between parked vehicles or from sidewalks. Vehicles might back out of driveways. To allow sufficient reaction time for any sudden movements, the driver should modulate speed toward the lower end of the city limit.

2. Steering Angle  
- The roadway ahead is essentially straight with a very gentle uphill grade. There is no significant left or right curvature.  
- There are no immediate obstacles in the travel lane; the trolley rails are flush with the road surface. However, the driver should maintain center of lane to avoid stray debris near the rail grooves.  
- With parked cars on both sides, there is a small risk of a door opening or a pedestrian stepping out. Remaining centered and steady in the lane ensures maximum clearance and preparedness to adjust steering if needed.

- The vehicle is on a multi-lane urban arterial at night. Typical posted limits on such roads range from 35–45 mph; vehicles often travel up to 55 mph when traffic is light.  
- Conditions appear clear and dry at night. There is no precipitation or fog, so traction is good. However, night driving reduces visual range, so the driver should avoid the upper extreme of the speed range.  
- Other agents:  
  • A lead car is visible ahead in the same lane at a moderate following distance. It may slow unexpectedly or change lanes.  
  • Oncoming traffic in the median lanes poses no direct speed hazard but indicates this is not a high-speed freeway.  
  • No pedestrians or cyclists are visible, but darkness could hide them near intersections or driveways.  

  To maintain safety, the driver should choose a moderate urban arterial speed that allows quick braking if the lead car slows or a hazard appears.

2. Steering Angle  
- The lane marking ahead is straight with no visible curvature.  
- No obstacles (debris, stalled vehicles, or construction cones) intrude into the lane.  
- Other agents:  
  • The lead vehicle may drift or swerve slightly if avoiding something, so the driver must stay centered and be prepared to make small steering corrections.  
  • Oncoming headlights do not encroach into the lane.  

  With a straight road and clear lane, minimal steering input is needed: keep wheels pointed forward and be ready for minor adjustments if the lead car maneuvers.

- The vehicle is on a multi-lane urban street approaching an intersection controlled by traffic lights. Typical travel speeds here are in the 25–35 mph range when moving.  
- Weather is clear and dry, so normal traction is available. However, the red signal ahead requires the vehicle to decelerate to a stop.  
- Several other vehicles (an SUV directly ahead, a sedan to the right, a pickup to the left) are already stopped at the light. They have no intention of moving forward until the light turns green. No pedestrians are visible, but cross-traffic could start moving once the light changes. These factors dictate keeping the speed very low and fully stopped (0–5 mph) until the signal permits proceeding.

2. Steering Angle  
- The travel lane is straight with no noticeable curvature.  
- There are no obstacles in the immediate path; the road ahead is clear except for the stopped vehicles.  
- Other agents remain stationary; no evasive steering is required. The driver should maintain a straight steering angle, aligned with the lane center, in anticipation of a straight-through green signal.

- The vehicle is driving on a multi-lane city street with parked cars on both sides and a posted speed limit sign around 40 mph. Typical speeds in this environment range from 35–45 mph when traffic is light.  
- The weather is overcast but the road surface appears dry and clear. Under these conditions one can safely maintain posted speeds, but should remain alert for hidden hazards (e.g., wet leaves, oil).  
- There are other moving vehicles ahead in the same lane and adjacent lanes, plus parked cars lining the curb. These could suddenly slow, merge, or open doors. Pedestrians might step off the curb between parked cars. To allow a safe reaction margin, the driver should travel below the maximum limit.  

2. Steering Angle  
- The lane ahead is essentially straight, with no sharp curves visible.  
- Parked vehicles along both sides pose potential obstacles if a driver or passenger suddenly opens a door or pulls out. Keeping the vehicle centered in the lane minimizes this risk.  
- Moving cars in neighboring lanes could drift inward or change lanes. Maintaining a straight heading with minor adjustments ensures the vehicle stays predictably in its lane and gives time to respond to any unexpected incursions.

- The vehicle is at a multi-lane city street intersection controlled by traffic lights. Typical travel speeds on such roads range from 25 to 35 mph.  
- It is nighttime and the roadway appears damp (reflections on the pavement), reducing tire grip and visibility. Under these conditions the driver should proceed with extra caution and be prepared to stop or slow more rapidly.  
- Three other vehicles are stopped at the red light (one in each lane ahead). There are no pedestrians visible crossing, but turn signals or sudden lane changes by those vehicles could occur. Maintaining a very low speed, approaching zero, allows the driver to avoid rear-ending the car ahead and react if another vehicle paces forward abruptly.

2. Steering Angle  
- The vehicle’s lane is straight through the intersection; there is no curve to negotiate.  
- No obstacles (potholes, debris, pedestrians) are present in the immediate lane.  
- The adjacent vehicles on the left and right are stopped and not intruding into the lane. Keeping the wheel centered ensures the car will proceed straight when the light turns green without drifting.

- The vehicle is driving on a multi-lane freeway. Typical speeds on such freeways range from 55 to 70 mph, depending on the posted limit.  
- Conditions are clear and dry with good visibility. In clear, dry conditions, the vehicle can safely travel near the posted limit but should still account for traffic flow and maintain a safe following distance.  
- Other agents: several passenger cars and light trucks are visible in adjacent lanes and ahead. They appear to be maintaining steady speeds with no sudden braking. There is potential for a merging vehicle from an on-ramp up ahead (signage and barrier locations suggest an entrance). To allow for a smooth merge and maintain safety, the driver should keep pace with traffic (around 60 mph) and be prepared to slightly adjust speed if a vehicle enters.

2. Steering Angle  
- The lane ahead is essentially straight with minimal curvature. The highway does not show any significant bend left or right in the immediate view.  
- No static obstacles (debris, stalled vehicles) are visible in the current lane. The shoulder and median are clear.  
- Other agents: nearby vehicles in neighboring lanes are maintaining lanes predictably. There is low risk of sudden lane-crossing because traffic is not congested. Steering should remain centered in the lane, with only small adjustments to stay equidistant from lane markings and to respond if a merging vehicle enters.

- Environment: The vehicle is at a city street intersection controlled by traffic lights. Typical driving speeds in this setting range from 25–35 mph.  
- Conditions: It is nighttime with clear, dry pavement and good visibility of lane markings. Under these conditions, normal cruising speed would still be 25–35 mph, but the red signal requires slowing to a stop.  
- Other agents: Cross-traffic has a green or yellow light, and oncoming vehicles are approaching the intersection. Pedestrians could enter the crosswalk on the green. These factors mandate reducing speed to a full stop (0 mph) until the light changes and the intersection is clear.

2. Steering Angle  
- Lane curvature: The lanes ahead are straight, but the vehicle is positioned in the left-turn bay.  
- Obstacles: A concrete splitter island and safety railing are visible to the right; steering must keep the vehicle clear of these.  
- Other agents: No vehicles are impinging on the turn lane, but oncoming traffic occupies the opposite direction lanes. To prepare for the left turn once the light changes, the wheels should be aligned slightly left to stay centered in the turn bay and avoid the median.

- The vehicle is on a multi-lane city street approaching an intersection. Typical speeds in this environment range from 25–35 mph, but when approaching a stop line or navigating traffic lights, actual speeds are often lower (around 5–35 mph).  
- Weather and road conditions appear clear and dry, so there’s no need for additional speed reduction beyond normal city driving practice.  
- There are several other vehicles stopped or rolling slowly in adjacent lanes. Cross-traffic could still enter the intersection on a green turn arrow, and pedestrians could step off the curb. To maintain safe following distance and be prepared to stop, the driver should keep speed in the lower city range.  

2. Steering Angle  
- The road ahead is mostly straight but gently curves to the right just past the intersection.  
- There are no static obstacles in the vehicle’s immediate path. All vehicles are properly aligned in their lanes, and lane markings clearly define the travel path.  
- Other drivers in adjacent lanes may drift or change lanes, especially trucks on the right. To stay centered in the lane and smoothly follow the roadway curvature, the driver needs a slight right steering correction.

- The vehicle is on a multi-lane urban arterial (city streets with a center turn lane, sidewalks, and adjacent buildings). Typical speed limits here range from 25–35 mph.  
- Weather/road conditions appear dry and overcast. No precipitation or low-traction hazards are present, so there is no need to reduce speed below a safe urban cruising pace.  
- Other agents: several passenger cars and a light truck are traveling in the same direction, with moderate spacing. Oncoming traffic occupies the left lanes. No pedestrians are currently crossing, but there are sidewalks and parked vehicles nearby, so the driver should remain alert and avoid sudden braking. The presence of preceding vehicles suggests maintaining a moderate following distance and speed in the 5–35 mph band (ideally toward the upper end, ~25 mph, but within that bracket).

2. Steering Angle  
- The lane ahead is essentially straight, with only a very gentle alignment following the road.  
- No immediate obstacles (potholes, debris, or stalled vehicles) are visible in the driver’s path. The curb and tree line on the right are static hazards but are well outside the lane.  
- Other agents are staying within their lanes; no swerving or encroachment is evident. Pedestrians are on the sidewalk, not in the roadway. Thus, no evasive steering is required — maintain a straight trajectory centered in the lane.

- Environment: The vehicle is on a multi-lane city street approaching an intersection controlled by traffic lights. Typical speeds here are in the 25–35 mph range.  
- Conditions: The pavement appears dry and the sky overcast but visibility is good. There’s no rain or snow to mandate heavy speed reduction; normal city speeds are appropriate, with some extra caution if lighting is poor.  
- Other agents: There is a lead car slowing slightly as it approaches the intersection and parked vehicles along the curb. Pedestrians are visible on the sidewalks but not yet in the roadway. To allow a safe reaction if the lead car brakes or a pedestrian steps off the curb, maintain a moderate city speed rather than accelerating to the maximum.

- Environment: The vehicle is in a parking lot aisle in front of a retail/restaurant building (an In-N-Out). Typical speeds in parking lots are very low, generally under 10 mph to allow for unexpected pedestrian or vehicle movements.  
- Conditions: The pavement is dry and visibility is clear, but the proximity of parked cars and potential foot traffic warrants an especially cautious pace.  
- Other agents: Numerous parked vehicles line both sides of the aisle. Pedestrians could step out from between cars, or another driver could back out of a space. To safely monitor these possibilities and have time to brake, the driver should maintain a crawl speed.  

2. Steering Angle  
- Aisle geometry: There are no formal lane markings, but the parking aisle veers slightly to the right as it passes the front of the building and curves toward exit lanes.  
- Obstacles: Parked cars tightly flank the vehicle on both sides. Poles, lamp posts, and landscaping elements are near the curb. A small rightward steering adjustment helps center the vehicle in the aisle and avoids clipping the cars or fixed objects.  
- Other agents: A pedestrian might emerge from between parked vehicles on either side, or a car could reverse into the aisle. A gentle right steering angle maintains maximum clearance on both sides and positions the vehicle for a quick stop if needed.

- The vehicle is driving on a multi-lane freeway at night. Typical speeds on this type of highway range between 55–75 mph.  
- Conditions are clear and dry, with good visibility of the road surface and lane markings but reduced ambient light. A dry, clear night permits freeway speeds but requires vigilance for glare from oncoming lights and brake lights.  
- Other agents include several vehicles up ahead in the same direction and oncoming traffic separated by a concrete median barrier. The cars ahead appear evenly spaced and moving at freeway pace. Their potential actions include sudden braking or lane changes, so the driver should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to decelerate. Given the flow, maintaining freeway speed (around 65 mph) is appropriate.

2. Steering Angle  
- The lane is essentially straight, with no sharp curvature visible.  
- There are no immediate obstacles in the lane; the roadway is clear.  
- Other agents (vehicles ahead and to the sides) are staying in their lanes. Their potential actions (such as drifting or lane changes) are minimal given the steady flow. Keeping the steering wheel centered to stay within the lane is the correct choice.

- The vehicle is on a multi-lane freeway at night. A typical speed limit on such freeways is around 65 mph.  
- It is raining or has just rained (water droplets on the windshield, wet roadway, low visibility). Wet conditions warrant reducing speed by 5–10 mph below the posted limit to maintain traction and safe stopping distance.  
- Other agents include several cars in adjacent lanes and ahead. They could brake suddenly or change lanes, so a safe following distance and a moderate speed are essential to allow reaction time.

2. Steering Angle  
- The freeway lane ahead is mostly straight but exhibits a gentle leftward sweep as it continues.  
- There are no static obstacles in the immediate path, but the wet surface and blurred visibility from raindrops demand precise lane-keeping to avoid drifting.  
- Nearby vehicles in the right lanes might merge or drift slightly; a slight left steering correction helps keep the vehicle centered in its lane and away from their blind spots.

- Environment: The vehicle is traveling on a multi-lane freeway. Typical speeds on this type of road range from 55–65 mph under normal conditions.  
- Driving conditions: It appears to be daytime with overcast skies and possibly light fog but no precipitation on the pavement. The road surface is dry and visibility is adequate. These conditions support maintaining the normal freeway speed range, with only a slight reduction if visibility worsens.  
- Other agents:  
  • A silver sedan is directly ahead in the same lane, maintaining speed.  
  • A white SUV is in the adjacent right lane, also traveling at a similar pace.  
  • Additional vehicles are visible farther ahead.  
Potential actions: the sedan could slow or change lanes; the SUV could drift toward this lane if merging. The driver should maintain a safe following distance (2–3 seconds) and be ready to adjust speed if the sedan slows or merges traffic changes.

2. Steering Angle  
- Lane curvature: The lane is essentially straight with no significant curvature.  
- Obstacles: No stationary or unexpected obstacles are present within the lane.  
- Other agents: The sedan ahead and the SUV to the right are the closest vehicles. Neither appears to be encroaching on the lane, but the driver should remain centered in the lane and prepared to steer slightly if the SUV drifts or if the sedan changes lanes.

- Environment: The vehicle is on a multi-lane urban/residential arterial (city street) with a posted 40 mph limit. Typical speeds here range from 30–45 mph when traffic is light and visibility is good.  
- Driving conditions: It is daytime with clear skies and a dry road surface. Under these conditions one can legally travel near the speed limit, but urban hazards (parked cars, cross-traffic) often warrant moderation.  
- Other agents: Cars are parked along both sides of the street and several vehicles are traveling ahead in the same direction. Parked vehicles may pull out, and moving vehicles may brake or change lanes. To maintain a safe following distance and allow reaction time for unexpected maneuvers, the driver should travel at a moderate speed within the 5–35 mph range rather than accelerating to the full limit.

2. Steering Angle  
- Lane curvature: The lane is essentially straight with no significant bends.  
- Obstacles: There are no immediate obstacles in the lane. Parked cars line the curb to the right and a raised median with vegetation lies to the left; the vehicle should stay centered in its lane.

- Environment: The vehicle is on a multi-lane freeway or highway section, likely an on-ramp or elevated interchange. Typical posted speeds in such environments range from 55–65 mph.  
- Conditions: The pavement appears dry and visibility, while overcast, is adequate. No precipitation or surface water is observed. Under clear, dry conditions, the vehicle can safely travel near the posted speed limit but should remain vigilant for changing conditions.  
- Other agents: Two cars are visible directly ahead in the same lane, one of which has its brake lights on. They may slow further for the upcoming merge or curve. To maintain a safe following distance and allow for smooth deceleration, the driver should moderate speed slightly below the typical limit until the behavior of those lead vehicles is clear.

2. Steering Angle  
- Lane curvature: The lane ahead is essentially straight with only a very gentle rightward alignment. No sharp bends are present.  
- Obstacles: There are no stationary obstacles or debris in the immediate travel path. Guardrails line both sides of the roadway but do not encroach on the lane.  
- Other agents: The lead vehicles remain centered in their lane and show no signs of lane changes or swerving. Given their steady trajectory, the driver can maintain a straight steering angle, correcting only minimally to stay centered.

- The vehicle is driving on a multi-lane divided freeway. Typical posted speeds range from 55–65 mph in this type of environment.  
- Weather and visibility are clear, with dry pavement and daylight. Under these good conditions, maintaining near the posted speed limit is appropriate.  
- Other agents: several passenger vehicles are visible in adjacent lanes and ahead. They appear to be traveling at freeway speeds with stable spacing. No pedestrians or cyclists are present. Maintaining a consistent speed reduces the risk of sudden lane changes or braking by others, so traveling at the prevailing freeway speed (around 60 mph) is advisable.

2. Steering Angle  
- The freeway lanes appear straight with no significant curvature in the immediate view.  
- No stationary or unexpected obstacles are present on the road surface.  
- Other vehicles: cars are maintaining their lanes without encroaching. Staying centered in the current lane with minimal steering correction keeps a safe buffer from vehicles ahead and in adjacent lanes.

- The vehicle is on a multi-lane freeway. Typical speeds on this type of highway range from 65–75 mph.  
- The weather is clear and the road surface is dry, allowing safe travel at or near the posted speed limit. No precipitation or low-traction conditions are present, so speed need not be reduced for environmental factors.  
- Other agents in the scene include a few passenger cars at a distance in adjacent lanes and an on-ramp further ahead. These vehicles are maintaining highway speeds and are not encroaching on our lane. Given adequate spacing and no immediate merges into our lane, the driver can sustain freeway speed while monitoring for vehicles entering from the ramp and adjusting if necessary.

2. Steering Angle  
- The lane ahead is essentially straight with no significant left or right curvature.  
- There are no stationary obstacles (debris, stalled vehicles) in the current lane. The concrete barrier and overpass supports are well outside the drivable area.  
- Other vehicles are traveling smoothly in parallel lanes and are not drifting toward our path. No pedestrians, bicyclists, or sudden obstacles are present. The driver should maintain a straight steering angle and keep the vehicle centered in the lane.

- The vehicle is on a multi-lane freeway at night. Typical speeds on such roads range from 55 to 70 mph.  
- Conditions are clear and dry, with good visibility of lane markings and reflectors. Night driving suggests maintaining the speed limit but staying alert; there is no precipitation or fog to force a major speed reduction.  
- Ahead and to the right there are other cars traveling in the same direction. They appear to be holding steady speed in their lanes. No pedestrians or bicyclists are present. To maintain a safe following distance, the driver should match the freeway flow, slowing only if the lead vehicles brake or merge suddenly.

2. Steering Angle  
- The lanes appear straight with no significant curvature. The dashed lines remain evenly spaced and parallel.  
- There are no obstacles in the immediate travel path—no debris, stalled vehicles, or roadwork cones visible.  
- Other vehicles remain in their lanes. A car on the right shoulder may re-enter if it’s stalled or broken down, so the driver should keep the wheel centered and be prepared to steer slightly left if that vehicle drifts back onto the road.

- The vehicle is driving on a multi-lane freeway at night. Typical speed limits on such roads range between 55–65 mph.  
- The road surface appears dry and visibility, while reduced by darkness, is clear (no rain, fog, or snow). Under these conditions, it’s safe to maintain freeway speeds, but the driver should remain alert.  
- Other vehicles are present ahead in neighboring lanes, all traveling in the same direction. They pose minimal risk of sudden pedestrian crossings but could change lanes or brake. Maintaining a steady speed of 55–65 mph with a safe following distance accommodates any minor speed adjustments they might make.

2. Steering Angle  
- The freeway lane curves gently to the right as indicated by the alignment of lane markings and the overhead bridge’s orientation.  
- There are no immediate obstacles in the lane—no debris or stopped vehicles—so no evasive steering is required.  
- Other vehicles are driving in adjacent lanes; should any drift unexpectedly, the driver can make a small corrective steering input to the right to remain centered in the lane and avoid encroaching on neighboring lanes.

- The vehicle is on a multi-lane city street, likely in a commercial area in front of a dealership. Typical speeds here range from 25–35 mph.  
- Conditions are clear and dry with good visibility. Under these ideal conditions, you could safely approach the upper end of the local limit, but traffic density and potential turns suggest a more moderate pace.  
- Other agents include:  
  • A light-colored SUV directly ahead in the same lane, which may slow to turn or park.  
  • A black sedan in the right lane that appears to be edging toward a driveway or side street.  
  • A pedestrian on the sidewalk near the dealership who could step off the curb.  
  These factors call for maintaining a cautious following distance and readiness to brake, keeping speed in the 5–35 mph range.

2. Steering Angle  
- The lane markings curve gently to the left as the road bends. The current lane is not perfectly straight—it arcs slightly.  
- There are no immediate obstacles in the vehicle’s path (no stalled cars or debris), but the SUV ahead may brake or change position. To stay centered in the lane and safely follow the curve, a slight left wheel input is appropriate.  
- Other agents:  
  • The SUV ahead could brake or swing wide into the turn lane.  
  • The black sedan to the right might merge into our lane if it decides not to enter the side driveway.  
  • The pedestrian on the curb could begin crossing unexpectedly.  
  A gentle left steering correction keeps the vehicle aligned with the roadway while preserving space from the sedan on the right and reacting smoothly if the lead SUV slows.

- The vehicle is stopped at a signalized intersection on city streets. Typical speeds approaching such intersections in urban areas range from 25–35 mph, but at the stop line the speed is effectively zero.  
- Conditions are dry and overcast. There is no precipitation, so grip is normal; however, approaching a red light still requires a full stop. The overcast light may slightly reduce visibility, reinforcing the need to remain stopped until the light changes.  
- Other agents: several vehicles are queued ahead and to the left waiting to proceed, and a gray compact car is executing a left turn across the intersection. No pedestrians are visible in the crosswalk but could emerge once the light changes. To avoid conflicts, the driver should maintain a stationary position (0–5 mph) until it is safe and legal to move.

- Where is the vehicle driving?  
  The vehicle is on a multi-lane freeway with a concrete median barrier on the left and several lanes of traffic. Typical speeds on such freeways range from 55 to 70 mph, depending on the posted limit.  
- What are the driving conditions?  
  Weather and road surface appear clear and dry, with good visibility under daylight. These conditions allow travel near the legal speed limit, assuming no construction or unusual hazards.  
- What other agents are in the scene?  
  There are multiple passenger cars traveling ahead and to the right. None are braking sharply or encroaching on our lane, but maintaining a safe following distance is prudent. No pedestrians or bicyclists are present. The driver should match freeway speed (around 60 mph) while monitoring for any sudden lane changes or slowing vehicles ahead.

2. Steering Angle  
- What is the curvature of the lane?  
  The roadway is mostly straight with a very gentle rightward sweep visible in the distant horizon.  
- Are there any potential obstacles in the driver’s way?  
  The lanes are clear of debris or stalled vehicles. No obstacles necessitate an evasive maneuver; only centering within the lane is required.  
- What other agents are in the scene?  
  Adjacent vehicles are maintaining their lanes. No one is veering toward the driver’s path. The driver should maintain lane discipline and make a minimal rightward steering adjustment to follow the slight curvature.

- Environment: The vehicle is on a multi-lane freeway. Typical speeds on such roads range from 55–65 mph.  
- Conditions: It appears overcast but dry, with good visibility and no precipitation. These clear, dry conditions support maintaining normal freeway speeds.  
- Other agents: Several vehicles are traveling in adjacent lanes at similar speeds. They may change lanes or adjust speed, but there are no slow-moving or vulnerable road users (pedestrians, cyclists) present. A safe following distance should be maintained, but no unusual hazards demand reducing below the speed limit.

2. Steering Angle  
- Lane curvature: The freeway ahead is essentially straight with only a very gentle alignment.  
- Obstacles: There are no visible obstacles on the roadway itself.  
- Other agents: Vehicles in neighboring lanes could drift or merge; the driver should keep the vehicle centered in its lane and make only minimal steering corrections to remain straight and avoid sudden lane intrusions.

- The vehicle is on a multi‐lane freeway (urban interstate) with overhead guide signs for routes to San Francisco and Pacifica. Typical speeds in this environment range from about 55–75 mph under normal flow.  
- Weather and road conditions appear clear and dry, with good visibility and no precipitation. These conditions support maintaining the normal freeway speed limit but do not warrant reduction for traction or sight distance.  
- Nearby agents include a white sedan in the adjacent lane on the left, a truck on the right shoulder, and several vehicles further ahead in the center lanes. None are braking abruptly or weaving; they all appear to be traveling steadily. This stable traffic flow allows the driver to maintain freeway speed without sudden deceleration.  

2. Steering Angle  
- The freeway lane is essentially straight with only a very gentle curvature. There are no off‐ramp diverges or sharp bends in the immediate view.  
- There are no obstacles (debris, stalled vehicles, pedestrians) in the lane. The roadway surface is even and free of hazards.  
- Other vehicles are holding their lanes predictably. No one is encroaching or indicating a lane change into the ego vehicle’s path. The driver should therefore keep the steering wheel centered, making only fine adjustments to stay within the lane markings.

- The vehicle is on a multi-lane freeway, where typical speeds range from 55–65 mph.  
- Conditions are clear, dry, and sunny. There are no visibility or traction issues, so the vehicle can safely travel at normal freeway speeds.  
- Other vehicles are moderately spaced in adjacent lanes and 2–3 car lengths ahead in the same lane. They may merge or change lanes near upcoming exits, but current gaps allow maintaining highway speed while keeping a safe following distance.  

2. Steering Angle  
- The lane ahead is straight with no significant curvature.  
- There are no static or dynamic obstacles directly in the lane (no debris, parked vehicles, or sudden obstructions).  
- Other vehicles are staying in their lanes with no immediate encroachment. The driver should maintain lane centering with minimal steering input.

- The vehicle is on a multi-lane city street (not a freeway or rural road). Typical posted limits here would be in the 25–35 mph range.  
- Weather is overcast but dry with good visibility; there is no precipitation to require a further speed reduction.  
- Traffic is heavily congested – the red Corolla directly ahead, a dump truck further up, a UPS truck in the right lane, and several other passenger vehicles are essentially stopped or creeping forward. They may brake suddenly or change lanes to bypass blockages. To maintain safety and avoid rear-ending, the driver should be moving at a crawl.  

2. Steering Angle  
- The lane in view has a very gentle rightward alignment (the curb and rows of parked cars on the right subtly suggest the road bows that way).  
- There are no immediate debris or construction obstacles in the lane, but the white van encroaching from the right lane and the parked cars along the curb narrow the available space.  
- Adjacent vehicles (especially the UPS van and the dark sedan in the right-hand lane) could drift slightly, so the driver should hold a slight rightward steering bias to stay centered in the lane and maximise buffer from oncoming lane changes.

- The vehicle is on a multi-lane freeway (highway). Typical speeds in this environment range from 55–70 mph.  
- The road surface appears damp (wiper in view, overcast sky). Wet conditions warrant a modest reduction in speed and increased following distance.  
- There are two vehicles visible in the same lane ahead, traveling at highway speed. They could slow unexpectedly or change lanes. To maintain a safe following gap, the driver should match the freeway flow but remain alert, suggesting a speed bracket of 55–65 mph.

2. Steering Angle  
- The freeway lane is essentially straight with no significant curvature.  
- There are no immediate obstacles (debris, stalled cars) in the lane.  
- The two vehicles ahead are centered in their lanes and not signaling a lane change; no evasive steering is needed. A straight steering alignment keeps the car centered.

- Where is the vehicle driving?  
  The scene shows a multi-lane, divided highway (freeway) at night. On such roadways, posted limits are typically between 65–75 mph.  
- What are the driving conditions?  
  It is dark but dry with no rain or snow visible. Night driving reduces visibility and reaction time, so a slightly lower pace than the posted limit is prudent.  
- What other agents are in the scene?  
  There are a few passenger vehicles ahead in the center and right lanes, maintaining moderate spacing. No pedestrians or cyclists are present. The cars ahead could decelerate or change lanes, so the driver should keep a safe following distance by moderating speed.

- The vehicle is driving on a multi-lane urban expressway or city highway. The posted speed limit sign visible on the right reads 45 mph, and typical operating speeds in this environment range from 35–55 mph depending on traffic flow.  
- Weather and road conditions are clear and dry with good visibility; there is no rain, fog, or snow. Under these conditions, the driver can safely travel near the posted limit but should remain alert and maintain a safe following distance.  
- Other agents: several passenger cars and a pickup truck are in adjacent lanes traveling in the same direction. These vehicles may slow, accelerate, or change lanes. Maintaining a moderate speed (slightly below or at the limit) allows sufficient reaction time for any sudden braking or lateral movement.  

2. Steering Angle  
- The lane ahead is essentially straight with no significant curvature. Lane markers run parallel without noticeable bend.  
- Potential obstacles: concrete median barrier on the left and dense trees or foliage on the right shoulder. No debris or construction cones are visible intruding into the lane.  
- Other agents: vehicles to the left and right may drift or merge; keeping the steering centered and smooth ensures the vehicle remains well within its lane and avoids encroaching on neighboring traffic.

- The vehicle is driving on a multi-lane divided freeway. Typical speed limits on this type of highway range from 55 to 70 mph, with most areas posted around 65 mph.  
- The weather appears overcast with light fog or low clouds, but the road surface looks dry and free of ice, snow, or standing water. While reduced visibility might normally suggest a modest speed reduction, conditions here are not severe enough to warrant dropping below the posted freeway speed.  
- There are several other vehicles in adjacent lanes and a handful of cars in the same lane at a reasonable following distance. None appear to be braking sharply or merging unpredictably. Maintaining a steady freeway pace (within the 55–65 mph range) keeps up with traffic flow without tailgating or impeding faster-moving vehicles.

2. Steering Angle  
- The lane ahead is essentially straight, with only a very gentle grade and no significant curvature.  
- There are no visible obstacles (debris, stalled vehicles, construction barriers) in the vehicle’s path.  
- Other vehicles are traveling parallel in neighboring lanes at stable speeds and trajectories. No one is signaling an imminent lane change into this lane. Therefore, minimal steering correction is required to stay centered; the wheel should remain virtually straight.

- The vehicle appears to be on a multi-lane city street or urban arterial (signalized intersection ahead). Typical speeds in this environment range from about 30–45 mph (35–55 km/h).  
- It is nighttime but the roadway is dry and there is no rain or snow. Reduced visibility at night suggests the driver should stay within or slightly below the posted urban speed limit to allow extra reaction time, so maintaining around 35–55 mph is appropriate.  
- There are no other vehicles, cyclists, or pedestrians visible in the immediate lanes. However, traffic signals ahead could change, and cross-traffic or pedestrians may enter the intersection when the light changes. This potential requires the driver to be prepared to decelerate, so a moderate speed in the 35–55 mph range is prudent.

2. Steering Angle  
- The lane ahead is straight. There is no noticeable curvature or turn in the visible road segment.  
- There are no obstacles (parked cars, debris) in the driver’s current lane.  
- No other moving agents are in the immediate vicinity that would require evasive steering (no pedestrians stepping off the curb, no side-street vehicles encroaching). The driver should keep the wheel centered to stay in their lane, ready to make small adjustments if the lane markings shift or if the road surface varies.

- The vehicle is driving on a multi-lane urban arterial or city street, not a high-speed freeway. Typical posted speeds in this environment are 25–35 mph.  
- The weather appears overcast but the pavement is dry with good visibility. Under clear or overcast dry conditions, the driver can maintain close to the normal speed limit but should remain alert for sudden braking in traffic.  
- There are several other vehicles in adjacent lanes and directly ahead (a mid-sized SUV immediately in front, plus cars in the left and right lanes). These vehicles may slow or change lanes at any time. To maintain a safe following distance and reaction time, the driver should travel below the upper end of the speed limit, in the lower 25–35 mph range.

2. Steering Angle  
- The lane is essentially straight with no noticeable curvature. Lane markings are visible, and the road ahead does not bend left or right sharply.  
- There are no immediate obstacles (debris or pedestrians) intruding into the lane. The shoulders have parked vehicles and a grass verge but do not encroach on the travel lane.

- The vehicle is on a multi-lane city street, not a freeway. Typical speeds here are in the 25–35 mph range.  
- The weather is clear and dry, so there’s no need to slow for traction, but city speed limits still apply.  
- Other road users include the black sedan directly ahead, a bus further up, and a white wagon in the adjacent lane. The bus may brake for a signal or stop to pick up passengers, and the sedan could slow unexpectedly. To maintain a safe following distance and be ready for sudden stops, the vehicle should proceed at a moderate city-street speed rather than at the maximum limit.  

2. Steering Angle  
- The lane markings ahead show a very gentle leftward alignment of the road rather than a perfectly straight line.  
- Parked cars on the right and a sidewalk with trees leave no room for drift; the driver must stay centered.  
- The white wagon in the left lane may drift toward our lane if it misjudges space, so a subtle left correction keeps the car away from that potential intrusion and maintains lane centering.

- Where is the vehicle driving?  
  • The scene is a city street or urban arterial, not a highway or freeway. There is a painted pedestrian crossing and street lighting typical of a residential/urban environment.  
  • Typical posted speeds in this environment range from 30–45 mph.  

- What are the driving conditions?  
  • It is nighttime and appears dry (no visible rain or snow on the road surface).  
  • Night driving reduces visibility, so the driver should be vigilant and maintain a safe speed that allows for timely reaction to unexpected events.  

- What other agents are in the scene?  
  • There are multiple vehicles ahead in the same lane and in the adjacent through lane, moving steadily.  
  • A vehicle is turning right from the cross street, and there is a marked pedestrian crossing just ahead (no pedestrians currently in it, but one could step off the curb).  
  • Potential actions: the lead cars might brake unexpectedly, the turning vehicle could merge, and a pedestrian could step onto the crossing.  
  • Impact on speed: maintain a moderate urban speed that allows for quick deceleration or stop (around 35–55 mph, leaning toward the lower end given the crossing).

2. Steering Angle  
- What is the curvature of the lane?  
  • The lane is straight; there is no visible left or right bend.  

- Are there any potential obstacles in the driver’s way?  
  • No static obstacles directly in the lane. The zebra crossing stripes are on the road, but not an obstruction—rather a cue to watch for pedestrians.  
  • No road debris or parked cars encroaching.  

- What other agents are in the scene?  
  • The vehicles ahead are traveling straight; the turning car to the right may swing into the lane but is currently completing its turn.  
  • No pedestrians are on the crossing, but one could approach.  
  • Impact on steering: keep the wheel aligned to stay centered in the straight lane, ready to make small adjustments if another vehicle merges or if a pedestrian steps out.

  • It appears dry and clear but with reduced visibility due to darkness. Headlights illuminate the road, but caution is prudent. Reduced contrast encourages maintaining a safe, moderate freeway speed rather than pushing the upper limit.  
- What other agents are in the scene?  
  • Two vehicles are visible several car-lengths ahead in the same lane. Their brake lights are off, indicating steady speed. There are no pedestrians, cyclists, or erratic vehicles. The driver should match the general flow (around the speed limit) while preserving a safe following distance, ready to decelerate if the lead cars slow.

2. Steering Angle  
- What is the curvature of the lane?  
  • The freeway gently curves to the right. Lane markings show a gradual rightward bend.

- Where is the vehicle driving?  
  The vehicle is on a multi-lane urban city street approaching a signalized intersection. Typical speeds on such roads range from 25–35 mph under normal traffic flow.  
- What are the driving conditions?  
  The weather appears overcast but dry, with good visibility and no precipitation. In these conditions, drivers can maintain posted speeds but should be prepared for stop-and-go traffic near intersections.  
- What other agents are in the scene?  
  Several vehicles are stopped or slowing ahead in each lane, waiting at a red light. There may be pedestrians crossing once the signal changes. Because the traffic is stopped and the signal is red, the driver should hold a very low speed (creep or full stop) to avoid collisions and to comply with the traffic control.

2. Steering Angle  
- What is the curvature of the lane?  
  The lane is straight, continuing directly toward the intersection with no visible bend.  
- Are there any potential obstacles in the driver’s way?  
  The primary obstacles are the vehicles stopped directly ahead. No lateral obstacles are present within the lane. Pedestrians or turning vehicles at the intersection could emerge once the light changes.  
- What other agents are in the scene?  
  Vehicles in adjacent lanes are also stopped; some may begin turning or pulling forward. Keeping the steering wheel centered ensures the car remains within its lane and is ready to go straight when the signal changes.

- The vehicle is driving on a multi-lane freeway at night. Typical speed limits on such freeways range from 55 to 70 mph, with 65 mph being common.  
- Conditions appear clear and dry (no rain streaks, no snow, good visibility of lane markings under headlights). In clear, dry nighttime conditions, a speed near the posted limit is appropriate, while maintaining alertness for reduced peripheral visibility.  
- Other agents: several vehicles are visible ahead and to the right, all traveling in the same direction and staying in their lanes. They do not appear to be braking abruptly or veering. To maintain a safe following distance at freeway speeds, the driver should match the traffic flow (around 55–65 mph) and be prepared to slow slightly if a lead vehicle decelerates.

2. Steering Angle  
- The lane ahead is essentially straight, with no significant left or right curvature. Lane markings run parallel without noticeable bend.  
- No stationary obstacles (debris, stalled cars) are visible on the roadway. The shoulders and median are clear.  
- Other agents: the vehicles ahead and in adjacent lanes are maintaining lane discipline. There is no indication of pedestrians, cyclists, or erratic drivers entering the lane. Steering should remain centered in the lane (i.e., straight) while monitoring mirrors and peripheral vision for any sudden lane changes by others.

- Other vehicles are visible in adjacent lanes and ahead at moderate spacing. They may maintain speed or change lanes gradually; none are braking sharply or encroaching. Maintaining highway speed keeps pace and reduces unnecessary lane changes.

2. Steering Angle  
- The freeway lane gently curves to the left. The white dashed lines bend slightly in that direction, indicating a gradual leftward curvature.  
- There are no obstacles (debris, stalled cars) in the lane. Guardrails and trees line the right side, but clearance is ample.  
- Other vehicles in neighboring lanes could drift or merge. A slight left steering adjustment keeps the car centered, while monitoring mirrors for nearby traffic before any lane shift.

- Environment: The vehicle is on a multilane urban street, likely a city thoroughfare adjacent to a gas station and residential sidewalks. Typical free-flow speeds here are around 25–35 mph.  
- Conditions: It is overcast but dry, with good visibility and no adverse weather. However, the road surface appears damp or recently wet, so traction is normal but caution is prudent.  
- Other agents: There is heavy stop-and-go traffic in the same lane, with brake lights illuminated on the car immediately ahead. On the left, another queue of vehicles is waiting to merge or turn. Pedestrians could step off the curb at any time. Given this dense traffic and potential for sudden stops or merges, the vehicle should crawl or remain nearly stopped.  

2. Steering Angle  
- Lane curvature: The lane ahead is essentially straight with no noticeable left or right bend. Lane markings are parallel to the vehicle’s heading.  
- Obstacles: No stationary obstacles are obstructing the forward path. Parked vehicles line the left shoulder, and a curb and sidewalk border the right.  
- Other agents: Adjacent vehicles may swerve or merge, especially the car in the left lane that could cut in. However, with tight spacing, the safest action is to maintain a straight heading centered in the lane.

- Environment: The vehicle is driving on a multi-lane freeway (an access-controlled highway). Typical speeds on such freeways range from 55–75 mph depending on local limits.  
- Driving conditions: It is a clear, dry day with good visibility and dry pavement. Under these conditions the vehicle can safely travel near the posted speed limit, provided traffic flow and spacing are maintained.  
- Other agents: There are several vehicles visible in the same and adjacent lanes, but all are at a safe distance. They may maintain speed or change lanes. To allow for safe reaction time to any sudden braking or merges, the driver should cruise near the speed limit but be prepared to decelerate if a vehicle ahead slows or merges unexpectedly.

2. Steering Angle  
- Lane curvature: The road exhibits a gentle rightward curvature as it follows the hillside.  
- Obstacles: There are no immediate obstacles in the driver’s lane. A concrete barrier runs along the left, and trees cast shadows on the right shoulder, but the travel lane itself is clear. The driver should maintain a steady lane-center position, gently steering right to follow the roadway.  
- Other agents: Vehicles ahead could drift within their lanes or merge. By keeping the steering aligned with the rightward curve and maintaining lane discipline, the driver minimizes the risk of encroaching on adjacent lanes and allows room for others to maneuver.

- Where is the vehicle driving?  
  - The scene is a multilane divided freeway (highway) with no traffic signals or cross-traffic. Typical speeds on this type of road range from 55–65 mph (or the posted limit, often around 65 mph).  
- What are the driving conditions?  
  - The weather is overcast but the pavement appears dry and visibility is good. There is no rain, snow, or fog limiting traction or sight. Under these conditions, maintaining a normal freeway speed is appropriate.  
- What other agents are in the scene?  
  - There are several passenger vehicles in adjacent lanes, including a white sedan slightly ahead in the center lane and more cars farther up. None are braking abruptly or weaving. They are all maintaining lane discipline and similar speeds.  
  - Because traffic is moderate and flowing steadily, the driver should match the prevailing freeway speed (while keeping a safe following distance) rather than slowing down unnecessarily.

2. Steering Angle  
- What is the curvature of the lane?  
  - The road ahead is essentially straight with only a very gentle, almost imperceptible, rightward sweep. There are clear, parallel lane markings.  
- Are there any potential obstacles in the driver’s way?  
  - No stationary obstacles or construction cones are visible in the lane of travel. Guardrails line the outer edge, but they do not encroach into the drivable area.  
- What other agents are in the scene?  
  - The surrounding vehicles remain centered in their lanes. None appear about to merge suddenly into our lane or swerve.  
  - Given this stable traffic flow and straight roadway, minimal steering correction is needed—the vehicle should continue straight, centered in its lane, making only very slight adjustments to stay aligned.

- The vehicle is driving on a multi-lane freeway. Typical speed limits on such freeways range from 55–65 mph.  
- The weather is clear, the pavement is dry, and visibility is good. Under these ideal conditions, maintaining near the posted freeway speed is appropriate.  
- Other vehicles are present: a beige SUV in the adjacent lane and a few cars farther ahead. These vehicles are traveling at freeway speeds and are not performing abrupt maneuvers. The driver should match the flow of traffic while keeping a safe following distance, ready to adjust speed if the lead SUV begins to slow.

2. Steering Angle  
- The freeway lane has a gentle curvature to the right, as indicated by the way the lane markings and the uphill grade bend.  
- There are no static obstacles in the lane. Should one appear (debris or a stalled vehicle), the driver would steer smoothly around it, but none are visible.  
- Nearby vehicles could change lanes or drift; in particular, the SUV slightly ahead may drift toward the center lane. To stay centered and accommodate any lateral movements by neighboring cars, the driver maintains a slight right wheel angle, aligned with the curved lane.

- Environment: The vehicle is driving on a multi-lane freeway at night. Typical speeds on this type of road are in the range of 55–75 mph, with common posted limits around 65 mph.  
- Conditions: It is clear and dry with good visibility from headlights and lane-line reflectors. These favorable conditions support maintaining highway speeds, though night driving requires slightly increased alertness.  
- Other agents: There are a few vehicles ahead in the same direction and distant oncoming headlights across the median. No pedestrians, bicyclists, or erratic traffic are visible. Maintaining a steady speed near the posted limit keeps a safe following distance and smooth traffic flow.

2. Steering Angle  
- Lane curvature: The freeway lane exhibits a gentle rightward curve, but it is gradual and well-banked.  
- Obstacles: There are no obstacles or debris in the lane. Traffic is centered in their lanes, and the shoulder on the right is clear.  
- Other agents: The lead vehicles are tracking straight within their lanes and are not making sudden maneuvers. No merging traffic or pedestrians are present that would necessitate a steer-away. A minimal steering correction keeps the vehicle centered, effectively “straight.”

- The vehicle is driving on a multi-lane freeway. Typical speeds in this environment range from 55–70 mph, depending on posted limits.  
- Conditions are clear and dry, with good visibility and pavement grip. This supports maintaining a speed near the legal limit but requires vigilance for traffic flow changes.  
- Several other vehicles are visible in adjacent lanes and ahead (pickups, sedans). They appear to be traveling at similar speeds with no sudden braking. No pedestrians or cyclists are present. The driver should match the flow, maintain a safe following distance, and be prepared to slow if any vehicle ahead decelerates or merges across lanes.

2. Steering Angle  
- The lane is straight with clearly marked white dashed lines indicating no significant curvature.  
- There are no obstacles (debris, stalled cars) encroaching on the lane.  
- Other vehicles may change lanes or drift; the driver should maintain central lane position and be ready for small steering corrections to stay centered and avoid encroaching on adjacent vehicles’ paths.

- Environment: The vehicle is on a multi-lane divided highway/freeway. Typical operating speeds on this type of roadway are between 55–65 mph, often with posted limits around 65 mph.  
- Driving conditions: The pavement appears dry and visibility is moderate under overcast skies. There is no rain, snow, or fog to warrant a speed reduction, so traveling near the posted limit is appropriate.  
- Other agents: Traffic is light to moderate, consisting solely of other vehicles in adjacent lanes. No pedestrians or cyclists are present. All vehicles appear to be maintaining their lanes and speeds. A stable traffic flow with safe following distances means the driver can comfortably maintain highway speed without frequent braking or acceleration.

2. Steering Angle  
- Lane curvature: The road gently bends to the right. The driver’s lane markings arc slightly rightward, indicating a mild right turn.  
- Obstacles: The right shoulder shows some pavement cracking and uneven surface, so hugging the lane center is safer than drifting right. No debris or hazards are visible in the travel lane.  
- Other agents: Vehicles ahead and to the left are holding their lanes without weaving. To remain centered within the curved lane and avoid the shoulder’s rough edge, the driver should steer gently to the right, matching the roadway’s curvature.

- The vehicle is on a multi-lane freeway at night, where posted limits are typically 65–75 mph; drivers commonly cruise around 65 mph.  
- Conditions appear clear and dry (no rain, snow, fog); visibility is lower at night, so maintaining a steady highway speed with full headlights is appropriate.  
- Other traffic: several vehicles ahead in the same lane and adjacent lanes, plus oncoming headlights on the far left. These cars may change lanes or slow for exits. Maintaining a 2- to 3-second following distance suggests holding roughly the speed of surrounding vehicles (around 65 mph) unless an immediate slowdown is required.

2. Steering Angle  
- The lane ahead is essentially straight with only a very gentle drift, indicating minimal curvature.  
- No static obstacles (debris, stalled cars) are visible in the lane; the clear roadway allows the steering wheel to remain centered.  
- Other agents in adjacent lanes could merge or drift, but there’s ample lateral space. A slight centered correction (“straight”) will keep the vehicle properly in its lane without oversteering.
